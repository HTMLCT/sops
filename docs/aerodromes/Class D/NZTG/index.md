??? info "Grass Runways"
        07 - Holding Point G - "Golf"

        25 - Holding Point F - "Foxtrot"

        16 - Holding Point W - "Whiskey Four"

        34 - Backtrack Seal 07

        04 - Only Accesible from Gliding Club.
        
??? info "Sealed Runway"
                                07/25 - A3 or A2 Used for Main Apron Movements

                                07 - W1/W2 - Light IFR aircraft

                                25 - E1/E2 - Light IFR aircraft


Upon Landing, Inbound aircraft will be told to either taxi to the apron or hold short of the grass due to departing/arriving traffic. If the latter has to occur, the aircraft must be instructed to taxi to A1/A2 and `Hold Short` of Grass 07/25.


## General Rules of Thumb

### Movement Areas

Aircraft will contact ATC before entering the movement area and will state their location after contact has been established.

Aircraft who need to taxi to the fuel pumps from any of the eastern hangars or Aero Club can do so without contacting ATC if they stay outside the Movenment Area, indicated by a dashed red line along Taxiway `E`

### Parallel Operations

If Both Sealed and Grass Runways are occupied and both aircraft are ready for departure, the aircraft on the Grass runway will be instructed to takeoff first. 

This is to avoid the need to wait 2/3 minutes for wake turbulence off the Sealed Runway. The aircraft who departs first will be instructed to make an early turn to allow successive departure of the waiting aircraft.

### Crane Operation

!!! danger
        Tauranga Port is Adjacent to Tauranga Airport and operates Multiple cranes up to 361 ft AMSL at 1.5 to 2.0 NM from Runway 07 Threshold.
