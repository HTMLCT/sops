## Procedure Assignment

### Runway 07

#### SIDs

Although our Controller Clients will usually assign the most suitable SID,
the rule of thumb is:

| Departure Direction    | SID               | Transition                 | Notes                              |

| North-West             | **UBSET 2P**      | **`NOBAR`**                | AA Traffic                         |
| South-East             | **TODAN 2P**      | **`OLDON` `FALLS` `ODOLO`**| WN/CH Traffic. Occasionally HN     |
|                        |                   | **`GOBUK` `PIBOV`**        |                                    |
| West                   | **BELET 3**       | **`DOTAR`**                | Radar Departure. Used for GA IFR   |

### Visual Departures

!!! note

        Visual Departures are almost never given in Tauranga, due to the SID being cancelled early on by Bay Approach
        most aircraft fly direct to the Transition Fix of the SID.
