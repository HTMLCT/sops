## Ground Movements

Auckland Ground is responsible for issuing taxi instructions and providing separation to all aircraft on the taxiways at Auckland Airport (NZAA)

### Use of Holding Points

| Type        | Runway 23L | Runway 05R |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Large Jets  | A1 / A1A   | A10        |
| Medium Jets | A2 / A3    | A9         |
| Turboprops  | A3 / A3A   | A9         |



Auckland Ground may assign the following reduced length holding points for departure without the approval of the pilot ("medium" refers to the wake turbulence category). Note that A3 and A8 holds are not used because pilots cannot visually check the approaches are clear before entering the runway.
