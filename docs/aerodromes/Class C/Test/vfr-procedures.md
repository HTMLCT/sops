### Rule Of Thumb

All arriving aircraft should keep seawards of the coastline and allow departing aircraft to pass on the land-side of the coast, this general rule is a safe way to keep traffic flowing efficiently in and out of the Aerodrome.


### Arrivals

All Arriving VFR aircraft should reference the preferred VFR arrival procedures as listed in the NZ AIP.

New Zealand AIP: <https://www.aip.net.nz/assets/AIP/Aerodrome-Charts/Tauranga-NZTG/NZTG_35.1_35.2.pdf>

These procedures should be followed where possible to avoid confusion.
