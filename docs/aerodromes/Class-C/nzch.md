## Control Positions

### Clearance Delivery

Clearances shall be issued by the Delivery position, and may given via DCL or voice.

When applicable, Delivery may issue taxi instructions in line with the [GCH Special Conditions](#gch-apron) or [Western Apron Special Conditions](#western-apron).

### Ground

#### Pushback

Pushback and startup clearances are managed by the Ground Controller. Due to the single taxiway at NZCH, the Controller shall ensure that pushbacks are carefully timed to allow for aircraft to taxi to both the runway and stands.

!!! info "Starting on Stand at the Terminal"
    Christchurch utilises W/E stands to allow for Props to park into the wind. Aircraft utilising these stands do not require a push-back, and may start on stand.

| Stands / Gates    | Usage               | Has a W/E stand? | Pushback Location | Notes                                                                                  |

Aircraft utilising Stands R1A, R1B, and R3A stands may start on stand. Aircraft utilising Stands R1, R2 or R3 must be pushed onto `A15`.
