## Auckland Tower

Auckland Tower is responsible for all aircraft operating within the AA CTR/C, from SFC - 1500ft and on all movement areas at Auckland Airport.

Auckland Tower is responsible for selecting the most suitable duty runway and the ATIS.

The duty runway will be the into-wind runway in most cases. However, other factors such as sunstrike may require an alternative take-off and landing direction. The Tower controller shall balance out these factors before deciding on the duty runway.

### VFR Procedures

Auckland Tower is resposible for VFR aircraft in the North or South sector (as depicted in the Auckland VFR Arrivals/Departures page in the AIP) ensuring they are separated from IFR traffic whilst on long final for an instrument approach. This does not include aircraft on some RNP approaches.

Tower is to assign VFR arrivals from the northwest to the northeast, the MANGERE BRIDGE arrival. For traffic from other directions, give joining instructions in plain language, using established VRPs or circuit procedures.

Tower is to assign northbound VFR departures the MANGERE BRIDGE departure. As flights to the west, north, and northeast require a turn against the circuit direction, Tower is to issue a specific instruction to turn using the phrase "**turn RIGHT/LEFT after departure, cleared for takeoff"**.

### Transfer of Communication & Control

#### Communication should be handed over

Arrivals  - once vacated the runway

IFR Departures - once airborne.
VFR Departures - once vacated your CTA.

#### Control should be relinquished

Departures - airborne, unless otherwise coordinated

Arrivals on a straight-in approach - at LENGU or EMRAG

Arrivals on a visual approach  - by 15 AA DME

Arrivals on an RNP approach, not straight-in - at ATAMA or NIPAS (RWY05R), ESNAX, ESMON, TEGIK, or TUSLO (RWY23L).

## Auckland Ground

Auckland Ground is responsible for issuing taxi instructions within the movement area and providing separation to all aircraft on the taxiways at Auckland Airport.

### Pushback & Movement Areas

Auckland Ground issues pushback and start-up advice/clearances to all departures. 

Ground uses positive control to ensure that no other aircraft passes directly behind an aircraft pushing back, even when the aircraft concerned are not on the controlled movement area, this includes the C aprons, such as C5.

### Transfer of Communication

Once Auckland Ground has issued all necessary instructions to the pilot, they advise the pilot to monitor Auckland Tower on `118.700 MHz`.

### Use of Holding Points

| Type        | Runway 23L | Runway 05R |
| ----------- | :--------: | :--------: |
| Large Jets  |  A1 / A1A  |    A10     |
| Medium Jets |  A2 / A3   |     A9     |
| Turboprops  |  A3 / A3A  |     A9     |


Auckland Ground may assign the following reduced length holding points for departure without the approval of the pilot ("medium" refers to the wake turbulence category). 

Note that `A3` and `A8` holds are not used because pilots cannot visually check the approaches are clear before entering the runway.

## Auckland Delivery

### Responsibilites

Auckland Delivery is responsible for the pre-departure issuing of IFR route clearances and VFR departure instructions at Auckland Airport.

Auckland Delivery shall also attempt to update the aircraft tags as much as possible to enable any information regarding the aircraft to be transferred to the next controller.

### Route Clearances

The SIDs are detailed in the table on the [Departures Page](../NZAA/Departures.md). 

Controllers should consider aircraft performance before assigning a SID. If in doubt, issue the AUCKLAND non-RNAV departures as these only require the default 3.3% climb gradient, or whatever vatSys assigns.

The notes on the SID table should assist in the SID assignment and streamline the process. On rare occasions the default SID may not be preferred - pilots may request any available alternative, including instructions in plain language. Requests not to fly the default SID require coordination closer to take-off time,  so inform pilots requesting an alternative they will get amended departure instructions from TWR at the holding point.

All SIDs require RNAV/GNSS unless otherwise stated.
