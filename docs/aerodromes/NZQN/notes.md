## Use of Taxiways

Queenstown has two parallel runway entry taxiways `A3` and `A4`. Usually the outbound aircraft will take the taxiway closest to the departure runway, and the vacating traffic will take the taxiway closest to the terminating end.

**For example** - If RWY 23 is active, aircraft will enter at `A4` and exit at `A3`. If RWY 05 is active, aircraft will enter at `A3` and exit at `A4`.

## General Rules of Thumb

### RNP Approaches

There are two RNP approaches per runway - the RNP Y or RNP Z. The RNP Y is used for Approach Category C or D aircraft (jet aircraft), whereas the RNP Z is to be used for Approach Category B aircraft, such as turboprops.

!!! information
    The RNP Yankee and Zulu approaches follow the same lateral path, but have differing vertical paths. For example, on the go-around for the RNP-Z 23, there are speed restrictions placed on the initial climb fixes to `QN737`. This forces the aircraft to gain altitude quicker.

### Departures

Queenstown is surrounded by significant terrain, so aircraft should stick to the departure path where possible. However, once the aircraft has climbed above the surrounding terrain, they may be cleared direct to their SID termination fix, where they can resume their filed plan.

## Procedure Assignment

### RWY 23

#### STARs

vatSys and EuroScope will usually assign the most appropriate arrival for that aircraft's flightplan. 

| Arrival Direction | Transition Fix | STAR             | Notes                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| NE                | ELRUV          | ELRUV 2A         | WN/CH traffic. AA traffic if using AAQN4 |
| N                 | DOVOT          | UBDAM 4B / DOVOT | AA traffic, if using AAQN2               |
| SE                | SUNGU          | SUNGU 4B         | NV traffic                               |
| W                 | ADKOS          | UBDAM 4B / ADKOS | Oceanic traffic                          |
| NW                | LIBLA          | UBDAM 4B / LIBLA | Oceanic traffic                          |

#### Approaches

All of Runway 23's STARs terminate at either `UGPED` or `ATKIL`, which are the IAF for both the RNP and back-up RNAV approaches. Category B aircraft should be given the RNP Z, and Category C/D aircraft should be given the RNP Y.

Aircraft unable to fly the RNP approaches can be issued the RNAV G or H. These approaches follow the general path of the RNP approaches, albeit with a higher profile. Both of these approaches end in visual circling segments to both runways. 

!!! danger "Heads up!"
    If you assign the RNAV G or H approaches to aircraft, you should expect them to **not** follow the visual segment. This significantly limits your runway occupancy, and increases the potential for conflict.

#### Missed Approaches

The Missed Approach for both RNPs have the aircraft climb to 10,000 feet and enter a hold at `SUNGU`. For aircraft unable to reach this altitude, they are to continue onwards to `NV`, climbing to 10,000 feet.

Due to the holding point also being a STAR commencement fix, aircraft may be given a `SUNGU` based STAR for another attempt.
