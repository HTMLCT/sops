!!! info "Faster Preview Server"
    You can opt to use a faster instance of the developer server by invoking the flag `--dirtyreload`. This just checks for any markdown that has changed since the HTML was rendered and will reconstruct any relevant pages only rather than rebuilding the entire website.

    ```
    mkdocs.exe server --dirtyreload
    ```

    !!! danger ""
        Navigation and new internal links may not get updated on other pages while using `--dirtyreload`. Verify links using the standard serve or build command.
