### Approaches

All Arrivals Terminate at `RUSTA` or `MORTA` 
which are the IAF for the RNAV Approach.

If Aircraft are visual they can report : `Callsign` `IAF` `Inbound` `Visual RNAV 07`

**For Example** `Tauranga Tower G'day ANZ145M, RUSTA Inbound, Visual RNAV 07`

!!! note
        Acknowledging the Aircraft does not clear them onto a visual approach
        aircraft must still follow RNAV restrictions.

### Missed Approach

In the Event of a Missed Approach aicraft will be instructed to carry out the published missed approach
which is as follows: climbing to 2000' left direct to `LETGU` then **HOLD** at `RUSTA 5000ft or Above`
