Auckland Radio is an Oceanic Control station that covers the entirety of the NZZO FIR, except where intersected by the NZZC and NZCM FIRs. In the real-world, radar coverage over this large area over the ocean is not possible - therefore "non-radar" procedures are used to ensure the separation of aircraft.

## Positions

There are two approved positions that can be staffed within the NZZO FIR. 

| Callsign   | Position Name         | RTF Designator | Frequency                    | Notes               |
