!!! danger "Heads up!"

    VATNZ's Oceanic and Pacific sectors are currently undergoing a refresh project, aimed at overhauling how our Pacific sectors operate, in addition to providing additional information to Controllers.

    This project is still underway, and elements of this Oceanic section **may not** be reflective of the current state of the network. This is annotated where appropriate.

VATNZ has responsibility for not only the NZZC sector, but also the NZZO and NTTT FIRs. These FIRs cover a variety of areas - ranging from the tropical paradise of French Polynesia, to the bitter cold of Antarctica.
