!!! note "Wellington Procedures"
    The WTMA procedures build upon information already contained in the [NZWN Aerodrome Procedures](../aerodromes/Class-C/nzwn.md), and any Controller logged on to WTMA should be familiar with those procedures.

## Positions

| Position Name   | Shortcode | Callsign            | Frequency | Login ID | Usage     |

### Transfer of Control Points

|Transfer Flow         | Requirements                                                  | Notes                                                                       | 
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| Tower -> Approach    | Once the aircraft becomes airborne off the runway             | Tower shall instruct all aircraft to contact ATMA airborne                  |
| Approach -> Control  | Once the aircraft are approaching the lateral bounds          | Aircraft may be handed off when nothing further is required of the aircraft | 
| Control -> Approach  | Once the aircraft is approaching the cleared level by control | Aircraft may not always be cleared to A110 when handed to ATMA              | 
| Approach -> Tower    | Once established on final (ILS/LOC) or over the IAF (RNP)     |                                                                             |

## Departures

Departures will be assigned by Wellington Controllers in accordance with the [SID Assignment guide](../aerodromes/Class-C/nzwn.md#sid-assignment). 

WTMA may climb departing aircraft as necessary to maintain separation and traffic flow up to their requested flight level. International aircraft shall be instructed to climb to `FL250`, if further climb is requested, they shall be handed to NAK.

For terrain clearance purposes unless the aircraft is departing from RWY 16 to the South, any track shortening shall be done above A025 to keep aircraft clear of associated terrain 


### Track Shortening

Aircraft under the jurisdiction of WTMA may be track-shortened or assigned a heading to assist with sequencing or for separation. 

ATMA may track-shorten where practical within their sector. Anything outside of thier sector must be coordinated with the appropriate sector.

### Short-Sector STARs

Refer to [Short Sector STARs](../aerodromes/Class-C/nzwn.md#star-clearance-for-nzns--nzwb)

## Arrivals 

NAK, OHA or KAI will hand aircraft to WTMA no lower than `A110`, unless co-ordinated.

### Track Shortening

WTMA should make use of track-shortening on STARs to allow for an efficient sequence to be applied.

## Woodbourne Procedures

WTMA will issue the appropriate STAR into WB unless already issued, and will descend aircraft and clear them for the nominated approach, once established inbound WTMA will hand aircraft to WB Tower

When Woodborne Tower is offline WTMA will provide top down services. 

## Paraparaumu Procedures

When PP FIS on watch, any IFR departures shall be coordinated. As PP is only a FIS, WTMA shall issue to the clearance to PP FIS and they shall pass it onto the aircraft. And aircraft will be instructed to `Passing 2,500ft Contact Wellington 119.3` during the inital clearance or during takeoff/becoming airborne. 

For aircraft departing NZPP, they shall be issued an Uncontrolled IFR clearance. Depending on traffic levels outside controlled airspace, they can either be required to validate their clearance before departure, or prior to entering controlled airspace.

## Uncontrolled IFR 

For Uncontrolled IFR aircraft leaving the WTMA control area, WTMA shall issue the appropriate STAR for that aerodrome, and clear the aircraft to leave controlled airspace on descent. 

If the aircraft is terminating underneath the WTMA control area, they shall be instructed to contact you on the ground to cancel their IFR flight plan. If their flight is terminating underneath another sector, such as OHA, they shall be instructed to contact that sector. This shall be coordinated.

## Coordination

### Wellington/Woodbourne Tower

WTMA shall coordinate with TAA on any requested approach that is not nominated in the ATIS. 

### NAK, OHA/OTMA and KAI

WTMA shall coordinate any track shortening outside of their control area.
